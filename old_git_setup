Steps (NOT THE RIGHT WAY, RESEARCH AND FIGURE OUT HOW THIS SHOULD BE DONE)
1) Install git
2) Create a directory on the server for the html files/site. Probably something like: /usr/share/nginx/html/seticorp.com in the case of digitalocean.com, or /var/www if a regular server, or something else if a rails app
3) Adjust the permission and ownership.  Something like: chown R www-data:jim directory, sudo chmod -R 770 seticorp.com/  (Later we'll change some of the file permission that we don't want the webserver to see back.)
4) 'git init' in the directory
5) On the local/development machine, without creating the directory, above where you want the directory, run clone ssh://jim@apoxeia.com/usr/share/nginx/html/seticorp.com
4) On the remote origin, run git status (should be master and clean)
5) git checkout -b deploy Otherwise you'll see: 
	error: src refspec deploy does not match any.
	error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://jim@apoxeia.com/usr/share/nginx/html/jamesmcbride.us'

6) Git status
7) Checkout branch deploy (git checkout deploy)
8) Change/add/remove files in this directory
9) git add .
10) git commit -am "Write message about changes"
11) git push origin deploy
12) In the website directory on the server, (for example, "/var/www/thecarringtonfirm.com") checkout the main branch if it's not aleady ('git status', then if needed 'git checkout master')
13) type 'git merge deploy'
